# Architectural Styles vs. Architectural Patterns vs. Design Patterns

## Architectural Styles:
- Monolithic
- Microservice
- Serverless

## Architectural Patterns:
- MVC(Model-View-Controller)
- MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel)

## Design Patterns:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral


## Conclusion
itâ€™s all about the scope: <br />
- An Architectural Style is the application design at the highest level of abstraction;
- An Architectural Pattern is a way to implement an Architectural Style;
- A Design Pattern is a way to solve a localised problem.
